# Assembler-Arnicomp

This repository is currently under development.

Assembler-Arnicomp is an assembler project designed for a breadboard computer that I have built. The assembler translates assembly code into machine code that runs on the custom hardware. In addition to the assembler, this project will eventually include an emulator and a compiler, both of which are still in progress.

## Project Overview

- **Assembler:** Fully under development. Converts assembly instructions for the Arnicomp breadboard computer into executable machine code.
- **Emulator:** Planned feature. Will allow you to simulate and test programs without physical hardware.
- **Compiler:** Planned feature. Will allow higher-level code to be compiled down to Arnicomp assembly.

## Status

- The assembler is the primary focus at the moment.
- Emulator and compiler are not ready yet and are still being developed.

## Getting Started

Documentation and usage examples will be added as the project progresses.
