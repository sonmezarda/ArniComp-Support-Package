# Assembler-Arnicomp

This repository is currently under development.

Assembler-Arnicomp is an assembler project designed for a breadboard computer that I have built. The assembler translates assembly code into machine code that runs on the custom hardware. In addition to the assembler, this project will eventually include an emulator and a compiler, both of which are still in progress.

## Project Overview

- **Assembler:** âœ… Fully functional. Converts assembly instructions for the Arnicomp breadboard computer into executable machine code.
- **Emulator:** âœ… Complete and tested. Simulates the ArniComp 8-bit CPU with Harvard Architecture, allowing you to test programs without physical hardware.
- **Compiler:** ðŸš§ Under development. Will allow higher-level code to be compiled down to Arnicomp assembly.

## Status

- âœ… **Assembler**: Complete with label resolution, constant support, and full instruction set
- âœ… **Emulator**: Complete with interactive debugger, step-by-step execution, and hardware-accurate simulation
- ðŸš§ **Compiler**: Expression parsing implemented, full compiler in progress

## Getting Started

Documentation and usage examples will be added as the project progresses.
