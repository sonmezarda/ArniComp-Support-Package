// Test: While loop with volatile condition (runtime)
// Expected: Normal while loop with condition check, variables invalidated after

volatile byte sensor;
byte counter;

sensor = *0x2000;  // Read from hardware

// This must be runtime loop (sensor is volatile)

// counter is unknown after loop (modified in loop)
// Expected: Full while loop with condition checking
