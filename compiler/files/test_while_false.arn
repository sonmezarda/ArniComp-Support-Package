// Test: While loop with compile-time FALSE condition
// Expected: Loop body should be completely skipped

byte a;
byte b;

a = 10;
b = 5;

// This loop should be skipped entirely at compile-time
while a < 5
    b = b + 1;
endwhile

// b should still be 5 (compile-time known)
// Expected: Only 2 LDI instructions (a=10, b=5), no loop code
